<h1>History of Solana</h1>

<div class="card">
  <p>
    Solana was founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former Qualcomm engineer.
    His goal was to solve the scalability problems faced by existing blockchains.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2020, Solana launched its mainnet and quickly gained attention due to its
    fast transaction speeds and low fees.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, Solana became one of the most popular blockchains for DeFi and NFT
    projects, attracting developers and investors globally.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, Solana continues to evolve as a powerful ecosystem in the crypto space.
